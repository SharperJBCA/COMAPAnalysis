# BASIC USE:

1) I recommend that you first copy the contents of this directory to a different working directory.

2) Next run the Makefile to compile the ephemeris library.
> make all

3) Create an outputs directory (by default this is "outputs" in the Parameter_Default.ini file).

4) Point the Parameter file to the data directory:
/scratch/nas_falcon/scratch/sharper/COMAP/testbed/data

5) There are lots of switches in the Parameters_Default.ini. You will want to modify the atmosphere section + the Atmosphere.py to do you analysis of the skydips.
