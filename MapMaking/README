# Mapping routines

> MakeMapSimple(tod, ra, dec, wcs)

Pass TOD, ra, and dec + an astropy WCS object and returns a 2D map array

MakeMaps(tod, ra, dec, wcs)

Pass TOD, RA, Dec and astropy WCS object. 
Expects arrays of:
TOD - (nhorns, nsidebands, nchannels, nsamples)
RA  - (nhorns, nsamples)
DEC - (nhorns, nsamples)

Destripe(tod, pixels,  offset, npix)

Pass TOD and pixels (calculate using WCS routines in Cartpix) as 1D arrays.
Offset is the destriping parameter (in number of samples)
npix is the number of pixels in the final map.

returns a 1D map vector that must be rearranged into the correct format.
